# 💕 YouTube & Netflix Data Analysis – Part 1, 2 & Netflix Part 3 🎉

Hey hey! 👋 Welcome to my *ultimate* data deep-dive into the glittery world of YouTube & Netflix 📺🍿  
This project started as a two-season series (Parts 1 & 2) but... surprise! I got super excited and dropped **Netflix Part 3** early because who can wait? 💁‍♀️✨

---

## 🌸 What’s New & Updated?

- 🚨 **Netflix Part 3 is LIVE**! I got too hyped and published this last part focused on Netflix only — because Netflix deserves the spotlight too!  
- 📊 Heads up! I used **sample data** for Part 3 instead of the full real datasets because Plotly threw a tantrum and refused to play nice with the big files.  
- 🗂️ The original datasets (both Netflix & YouTube) are from Kaggle but are a bit vintage (think 2020 vibes 🕺). So, take this analysis with a splash of nostalgia!

| `Netflix_Part3.ipynb` | The Netflix spotlight 🔥 — fresh insights, animations (yes, masala included 🌶️), and some slaying dashboards (minus Plotly’s diva behavior) |

## 🧚‍♀️ Tools I Wielded (Like a Data Wizard 🪄)

- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `networkx`, `numpy`, `itertools`, `collections`, and a pinch of `mpl_toolkits` for 3D magic 🥺✨

## 💡 The Plot (aka What You’ll Learn)

- ✨ How to turn messy data into something that slaps  
- 🔍 YouTube & Netflix trends — old-school 2020 style but still gold  
- ❤️ What drives engagement (spoiler: it’s not just the thumbnail)

## ⚠️ Heads Up!

- Datasets are **not included** here because they’re big and clingy 🙅‍♀️ — grab your own from Kaggle if you want the full experience.  
- The original datasets are from 2020-ish, so the concepts might feel a little retro 📼.  
- Plotly decided to throw shade, so Netflix Part 3 uses **sample data** — but the insights still shine bright!  
- All charts are static (just like my emotional availability when debugging).  
- Made with midnight thoughts, VS Code, Google Colab, and *way* too much excitement about data ✨
