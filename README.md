# 💕 YouTube & Netflix Data Analysis – Complete Series (Parts 1, 2, Netflix Part 3 & YouTube Part 3) 🎉

Hey hey! 👋 Welcome to my ultimate deep-dive into the sparkling worlds of YouTube & Netflix 📺🍿  
What began as a chill two-part project quickly turned into a four-part data extravaganza — and guess what?  
**YouTube Part 3 just dropped and completely stole the show, gurllll!** 💅🎬

## 🌟 What's New in YouTube Part 3?

The final and **most exciting** addition is here — **YouTube Part 3** brings bold storytelling and creativity into data analytics with:

🎤 Voice-to-Text Polarity exploration  
🎥 A short artistic documentary (with fade-in/out transitions)  
🎯 Highlights and annotations to draw attention to key findings  
💫 Floating emojis and storytelling via animations  
📈 A mix of advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams, chord diagrams, heatmaps, and animated quarterly trends  
🎞️ GIFs, animated charts, and emotional trends — all packed in!  
💡 The outputs are cleared for clarity, and I removed some install cells to make things neater — just install any required libraries when you run the notebook

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🗂️ Datasets used are from around 2020, so the analysis has a slightly vintage feel  
- 📦 Large files were swapped with sample datasets in Netflix and YouTube Part 3 and part 2 sometimes due to Plotly performance issues  
- 🧹 Outputs were cleared in YouTube Part 3 to keep things neat and review-friendly  
- 📥 Some libraries may not be included — just install them before running  
- 🤖 No Scikit-learn or ML content here — **that’s coming soon in my Project 2** 🔮
