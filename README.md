# 💕 YouTube & Netflix Data Analysis – Part 1 & 2 ✨

Hey hey! 👋 Welcome to my *ultimate* data deep-dive into the glittery world of YouTube & Netflix 📺🍿  
This project is served in two juicy parts — like a two-season series where the second season is even better 💁‍♀️.

So grab your matcha latte, put on your fave lo-fi beats, and let's dig into some ✨data drama✨.
And right there, stay hydrated my peeps! <3

## 🌸 What's Inside the Notebook Closet?

| Notebook | Vibe |
| -------- | ---- |
| `Project_part_1.ipynb` | The glow-up episode 💅 — data cleaning, wrangling, and turning chaos into ✨girly structure✨ |
| `Project_part_2.ipynb` | The drama unfolds 🎭 — visualizations, insights, comparisons, and all the storytelling bits you came for |

🚫 Datasets (taken from mother Kaggle 🙌) not included (we’re keeping this repo ✨lean & clean✨)  
❌ Plotly didn’t make the cut (static charts slay anyway)  
📓 Completely Jupyter, Google Colab friendly notebook and added skin hyaluron like VS Code

## 🧚‍♀️ Tools I Wielded (Like a Data Wizard 🪄)

Here’s what’s in my digital makeup bag:

- (/≧▽≦)/ - `pandas` – queen of spreadsheets turned Python 🐼✨  
- ( *︾▽︾) -  `matplotlib` + `seaborn` – for all those pretty plots  
- \^o^/ - `scipy` – brains behind the stats 📐  
- (*>﹏<*) -  `networkx` – let’s make some connections, literally 🕸️  
- q(≧▽≦q) - `numpy`, `itertools`, `collections` – the behind-the-scenes tech support squad 💻💕
- ヾ(≧▽≦*)o `mpl_toolkits` - added for 3D Axes 🥺

## 💡 The Plot (aka What You’ll Learn)

- ✨ How to turn messy data into something that slaps
- 🔍 Trends that make content pop on YouTube
- ❤️ What drives engagement (spoiler: it’s not just the thumbnail)
- 📊 Netflix vs. YouTube — who’s winning the screen-time war?
- 🧬 Correlations, stats, and connections you didn’t see coming
- 🔗 Graphs that look like social circles (but for data)

## ⚠️ A Quick PSA 💌

- Datasets were too clingy 🧳 so I let them go — you’ll need to bring your own
- Make sure before running the cells in colab, the datasets arent loaded since plotly tried to be *shy* 😒 and gave a hard-time 😢 
- All charts are static, just like my emotional availability when debugging
- Made with VS Code, Google Colab, midnight thoughts, and ✨a lil too much excitement about data✨
