💕 YouTube & Netflix Data Analysis – Complete Series (Parts 1, 2, Netflix Part 3 & YouTube Part 3) 🎉



Hello there everyone!👋Welcome and lets dive into the deeper analysis of YouTube and Netflix📺🍿



What began as a chill two-part project quickly turned into a four-part data extravaganza — and guess what?  

*YouTube Part 3 just dropped and completely stole the show, gurllll!* 💅🎬

🌟 What's New in YouTube Part 3?



The final and most exciting addition is here — YouTube Part 3 brings bold storytelling and creativity into data analytics with:



🎤 Voice-to-Text Polarity exploration  

🎥 A short artistic documentary (with fade-in/out transitions)  

🎯 Highlights and annotations to draw attention to key findings  

💫 Floating emojis and storytelling via animations  

📈 A mix of advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams, chord diagrams, heatmaps, and animated quarterly trends  

🎞 GIFs, animated charts, and emotional trends — all packed in!  

💡 Outputs are cleared for clarity, and I removed some install cells to keep it neat — just install any missing libraries when running!

⚠ Important Notes



🗂 *Datasets used* are from around 2020, so the analysis has a slightly vintage feel:  

- 📺 [Netflix Movies & TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  

- 📹 [YouTube Trending Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new)



📦 Large files were swapped with sample datasets in Netflix and YouTube Part 3 (and Part 2 at times) due to Plotly performance issues  

🧹 Outputs were cleared in YouTube Part 3 to keep things neat and review-friendly  

📥 Some libraries may not be included — just install them before running  

🤖 No Scikit-learn or ML content here — that’s coming soon in my *Project 2* 🔮
